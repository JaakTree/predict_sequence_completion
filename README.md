# predict_sequence_completion

We develop a framework for predicting how an ongoing instance of a business process will unfold up to its completion. Specifically, for a given point during the process case execution, we extract all possible completion scenarios how this case may unfold up to its completion and estimate probabilities of various scenarios. In this project we report only the most likely scenario.

# Approach 1
 
K-Nearest Neighbors
 
# Approach 2

Annotated transition system (ATS)
